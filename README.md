<h1>horiseon-code-refactor</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This was a lesson in understanding how to refactor code in our first bootcamp challenge.<br></p>

<p>We were provided the HTML and CSS code to refactor and our task included the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Replace the old div elements with the more SEO friendly semantic elements.</li>
    <li>Consolidate extraneous CSS elements and keep the functionality the same,</li>
    <li>Add alt attributes to the images on the site to aid SEO rankings.</li>
  </ul>
